# Task Board

This task board was created to add individual project tasks, manage their state of progress and track overall project progress accordingly.

## Description

This task board was created as a challenge for bootcamp students to apply everything that was learned in module 5 of class. The challenge will make this app run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery, jQuery UI, and Day.js.

## Acceptance Criteria

    - Having a source code.
    - Given a task board to manage a project.
    - When task board is opened the list of project tasks is displayed in columns representing the task progress state (To do, In Progress, Done)
    - When I view the task board for the project each task is color coded to indicate whether it is nearing the deadline (yellow), overdue (red), future (green), and done (white).
    - When I click on the Add Task button I can enter the task name, task description, and task due date for the new task into a modal dialog.
    - When I click the save button for that task, the properties for that task are saved in localStorage.
    - When I drag a task to a different progress column the task's progress state is updated accordingly and will stay in the new column after refreshing.
    - When I click the delete button for a task the task is removed from the task board and will not be added back after refreshing.
    - When I refresh the page the saved tasks persist.
